Description: Tools for creating more complex QTL plots for publication
    than the base tools in r/qtl allow. In particular, plots with multiple
    lanes per chromosome can be created to show, for example, different
    traits, or results from replicate experiments. Additional tools are
    provided for grouping QTL if their credible intervals overlap.
